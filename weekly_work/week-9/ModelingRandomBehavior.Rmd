### Modeling Coin Flips

#### One coin:

```{r onecoin}
#  Having R flip one coin:

```

#### 10 coins at once, Heads and Tails

``` {r tencoins}

```

#### 10 coins at once, printing Trial Result:  number of heads

```{r trialresult}
#  To do sets of 10 -- this prints the 
#  "Trial Result"  -- the number of
#   heads in one trial of 10 tosses:

```

#### Do a bunch of trials of 10 coins

```{r manytrials}
#  Same thing with bigger n

```

### Modeling Free Throws for a 90% shooter

```{r freethrows}
#  Having R do one free throw:

#  To do all 10 at once:

#  To do sets of 10 -- this prints the 
#  "Trial Result"  -- the number of
#   Made free throws in 10 attempts: 

#    Do a bunch of trials:
 
```


### To do the Burning House hypothesis test
#### Simulate 17 choices of house, if houses are equally likely

```{r burninghouse}

```

### To do the 80% shooter hypothesis test
#### Simulate 20 free throws, if person is really an 80% shooter

```{r}

```
