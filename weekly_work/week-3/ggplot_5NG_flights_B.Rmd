### Setup

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load ggplot2 or the tidyverse when you want to use it:
library(tidyverse)

#  We'll use the package dplyr, so install it and load it.  Or just install and load the tidyverse:

#  We'll also use the package nycflights13, so install and load that, too:
library(nycflights13)

```


###  The 5NG -- Five Named Graphs, from Modern Dive

-  scatterplot
-  linegraphs
-  boxplots
-  histograms
-  bar graphs

#### 1. scatterplot

```{r flights}
# We'll use the flights data frame, in nycflights13 package
#  take a look at the data
tibble(flights)
names(flights)

#  Make a data frame with only the Alaska airlines flights
all_alaska_flights <- flights %>% 
  filter(carrier == 'AS')

#  Make a scatterplot of arrival delay BY departure delay
ggplot(data = all_alaska_flights,
       mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point(size = .5, alpha = .3)

#  To see the dense part better:
#  in the geom_point()  
#  add  size = .5   (default size = 1)
#  use alpha = .3   (default is 1)
```

#### 2. linegraph

```{r linegraphs}
#  the data frame, weather, in nycflights13, has weather for every hour of 2013.  We'll focus on weather in the first half of January only for the Newark airport.

early_january_weather <- weather %>% 
  filter(month == 1  & day < 15  &  origin == 'EWR')

#  Look at temperature over time.  (Temperature BY time)
ggplot(data = early_january_weather,
       mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) +
  geom_line()

#  Now look at temperature over time with the full data frame:
```

#### 3. boxplots

```{r boxplots, warning = FALSE}
#  Using full data frame, make boxplots of temperatures by month

```

#### 4. Histograms and density plots

```{r histograms, warning = FALSE}
#  Make a histogram of temperatures, using fill and color.

#  Make a density plot of temperatures, using fill and color.

#  Do histogram and density plots *by month*, using facets

#  histograms by month

#  density by month

```

####  5. bar graphs

```{r bargraph}

#  Try a bar graph of month

```
