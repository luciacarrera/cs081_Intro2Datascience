## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r market}
tibble(g)
BreadMilk <- g %>% summarise(sumBread = sum(Bread),
                 sumMilk=sum(Milk),
                 sumBoth=sum(Bread * Milk),
                 N = n(),
                 supBread = sumBread/ N,
                 supMilk = sumMilk /N,
                 supBoth = sumBoth / N,
                 Confidence = supBoth / supBread,
                 Lift = Confidence /supMilk)
# to print it :
BreadMilk

FruitMilk <- g %>% summarise(sumFruit = sum(Fruit),
                 sumMilk=sum(Milk),
                 sumBoth=sum(Fruit * Milk),
                 N = n(),
                 supFruit = sumFruit/ N,
                 supMilk = sumMilk /N,
                 supBoth = sumBoth / N,
                 Confidence = supBoth / supFruit,
                 Lift = Confidence /supMilk)

# to print it :
FruitMilk

```
