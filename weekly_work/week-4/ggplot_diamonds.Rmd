### Setup

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load ggplot2 or the tidyverse when you want to use it:
library(tidyverse)

#  We'll use the package dplyr, so install it and load it.  Or just install and load the tidyverse:

```

### More graphs:  the diamonds data

```{r look}
#  We'll use the diamonds data frame, stored in ggplot2.  Take a look at it:
tibble(diamonds)

#  For more info, do help(diamonds) on the console
help(diamonds)
```

### Look at diamond weight (the variable, carat)
The shape of the data
```{r carat, warning = FALSE}
#  histogram of carat  (diamond weight)
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = carat)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = 'darkgreen', color = 'blue')

#  density plot -- smoothed histogram
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = carat)) + 
  geom_density(fill = 'darkgreen', color = 'blue')

```


###  Look at categorical variables (cut, color, clarity)

```{r bars}
#  Make bar graphs of each:
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

### Bar graph with two variables: Cut and clarity

```{r}
#  Map clarity to the x axis, and cut to the fill aesthetic.
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = clarity, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_bar(position='fill')

```

###  Look at length and width of diamonds

```{r lengthwidth}
#  Scatterplot of y by x
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes (x=x, y=y))+
  geom_point()

#  remove the outliers:
d <- diamonds %>% filter( y < 20 & x > 30 ) //wrong values
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes (x=x, y=y))+
  geom_point()
```

###  boxplots of price by cut

```{r pricecut}
#  Do ideal cut diamonds cost more or less?   Why?
ggplot()

```

### More graphs to figure it out....

```{r why}

```
