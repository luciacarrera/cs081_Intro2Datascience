### Review the ideas outlined in the Reading for chapters 1 and 2.

### Review these ideas from class:

* Data Structures:  vectors, data frames are the two we've used so far. (Others include matrices, arrays, lists)
  + Vectors: Height <- c(163, 133, 190)

* Data Types in R:  Logical, Numeric, Character/String
  + Logical: TRUE, FALSE
  + Numeric: 163, 133, 190
  + Character: 'Pass', 'Fail', 'Samantha'
  
* Quantitative vs Categorical data:  
  + Quant:   age, earnings
  + Categ:   year in school, response (yes/no)

* R is case sensitive!!!

* How are missing values represented in R?  
  + NA (NOT IN QUOTES " !)
  
* How to remove missing values so mean(Height) will run?
  + mean(Height, na.rm=TRUE)
  
* How do you get out of the + prompt?  
  + esc (escape sequence)
  + Correctly finish prompt

* Functions and arguments (which are which below?):
  + mean(Height) : mean = function, Height = argument
  + sqrt(25) : sqrt = function, 25 = argument 
  + mean(S$Earnings, na.rm=TRUE) : mean = function, ... = arguments


* What is the meaning of   <-   in R
  + Assign

* Programs and Packages:  
  + R is a program;  
  + dplyr, ggplot2, tidyverse are packages

* Installing and Loading:  How and when must you install/load packages?
  1. Click on the “Packages” tab.
  2. Click on “Install” next to Update.
  3. Type the name of the package under “Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):” In this case, type ggplot2.
  4. Click “Install.”
  5. Load package by writing: library(ggplot2)


###  Practice Writing Code

#####  Enter these vectors in R:

```{r entervectors}
#  Animal:  cat, dog, pig, opossum, horse, human
#  Sleep:  12.5, 10.1, 9.1, 18.0,  2.9, 8
#  REM:  3.2, 2.9, NA, 4.9, 0.6, 1.9   (don't put the NA in quotes)
#  Brain:  .026, .07, .18,.006, .655, 1.32
#  Body:  3.3, 14, 86.2, 1.7, 521, 62

Animal <- c('cat', 'dog', 'pig', 'opossum', 'horse', "human")
Sleep <- c(12.5, 10.1, 9.1, 18.0,  2.9, 8)
REM <- c(3.2, 2.9, NA, 4.9, 0.6, 1.9)
Brain <- c(.026, .07, .18,.006, .655, 1.32)
Body <- c(3.3, 14, 86.2, 1.7, 521, 62)
```

##### Stats and new vectors

```{r vectorstats}
#  Have R calculate the mean Body size 
mean(Body)

#  Have R calculate the mean REM sleep time
mean(REM, na.rm=TRUE)

#  Do a summary of the Body vector
summary(Body)

#  Create new vectors:  LBrain is the log of Brain and LBody is the log of Body
#  Note:  You may use the function log() OR the functionlog10()
LBrain <- c(log(Brain))
LBody <- c(log(Body))

```

##### Some plots

```{r plots}
#  Try some plots:   Brain by Body (Y by X),  LBrain by LBody
plot(x = Body, y = Brain)
plot(x = LBody, y = LBrain)

#  Also:  Sleep by Body, then Sleep by LBody
plot(x = Sleep, y = Body)

```

##### Make and use a data frame

```{r dataframe}
#  Put the vectors in a data frame, called an:
an <- data.frame(Animal, Body, Brain, LBody, LBrain, REM, Sleep)

#  Because it is small, you can print the data frame to make sure it looks correct.
print(an)

#  Try these functions to examine the data frame further:  dim, head, tail, str, names.
dim(an) # Retrieved the dimensions of an object
head(an) # Is used to get the first parts of a vector, matrix, table, data frame or function
tail(an) # Is used to get the last parts of a vector, matrix, table, data frame or function
str(an) # Used for compactly displaying the internal structure of a R object.
names(an) # Used to get or set the name of an Object.

#  Remove the vectors from your environment, using rm()
rm(Animal, Body, Brain, LBody, LBrain, REM, Sleep)
   
#  Do summary() on the whole data frame
summary(an)

#  Now, redo the plots using plot and an$
plot(x = an$Body, y = an$Brain)
plot(x = an$LBody, y = an$LBrain)
plot(x = an$Sleep, y = an$Body)

```
