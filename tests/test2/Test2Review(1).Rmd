```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

```


### First, read in Happiness data

##### Download **happiness.csv** from the DATA link on Blackboard.

##### Read it in, calling it HI. Three ways to read it in:

* Use file.choose() and browse for it
* Give a complete path to the file
* (Preferred Method) Put the file in your project directory, and read using just the file name.


```{r getdata}
#  Browse for it:
#   HI <- read.csv(file.choose())

#  State a complete path to the file:
#   HI <- read.csv('/Users/sweaver/Desktop/StatCS 087A S21/Happiness.csv')

#  Or the preferred method:  Put the file in your project directory, make sure you are IN your project, and read using just the file name.
HI <- read.csv('HappinessIndex.csv')

#  Do dim and names, then print a tibble of the data to see what is in it.
dim(HI) # Retrieves or set the dimension of an object.
names(HI) # lists variables
View(HI)

```

### Now read more about the data:  

##### Go to this link: [Happiness Data Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h8hh-E241ipv7g1c5EoOgWTcK6HlWdQmCLJt7wJ-NWM/edit?usp=sharing), and focus mainly on the variables: score, life expectancy, and GDP per capita. (Note: you will need to open the knitted document in your browser to access the link -- or copy/paste the link)

### Histograms

Describe here

```{r histograms}
#  Have R do a histogram of score.  Also do (separately) a histogram of life expectancy.  Also do a (separate) histogram of GDP per capita.  Describe above the shapes of the distributions.
ggplot(data = HI, 
       mapping = aes(x=score))+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(data = HI, 
       mapping = aes(x=lifeExpectancy))+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(data = HI, 
       mapping = aes(x=gdpPerCapita))+
  geom_histogram()
```

### Some Stats

Describe here

```{r stats}
# Use the mean() function to have R calculate the mean of each of these three variables.  Also, calculate the median for each variable.  Do the means and medians tend to be similar for each variable?   Explain above.
summary <- HI %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std_dev = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE))
summary
summary <- HI %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(lifeExpectancy, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std_dev = sd(lifeExpectancy, na.rm = TRUE))
summary
summary <- HI %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(gdpPerCapita, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std_dev = sd(gdpPerCapita, na.rm = TRUE))
summary
```

### Scatterplots

```{r scatter}
#  Have R do two scatterplots:   score by life expectancy      and    score by GDP per capita.
ggplot(data = HI, 
       mapping = aes(x=lifeExpectancy, y=score))+
  geom_point()

ggplot(data = HI, 
       mapping = aes(x=gdpPerCapita, y=score))+
  geom_point()
```
```{r scatter}
# More practice
#	Create a scatterplot with ggplot, using colored points, determined by another variable
ggplot(data = HI, 
       mapping = aes(x = score)) +
  geom_density(fill="blue") +
  facet_grid()


#	Create a bar graph, with bars filled with color, determined by another variable
#	Create a boxplot, with bars filled with color, determined by another variable
#	Create a histogram or density plot for one quantitative variable.
#	Create a density plot, using facet_grid or facet_wrap, to introduce a second variable
#	Use labs() to add a title, or a label for axes 


###Data Transformation and Summary:

##	Know what Tidy Data is

##	Know these data verbs in dplyr and what each is used for:   

# filter, mutate, group_by, summarise, arrange, select, sample_n 

##	Know how to do the following coding tasks:

#	Finding mean, sd, median, etc., for a vector, using base package  
#	Finding mean, sd, median, etc., for a vector, using dplyr (with summarise)  
#	Know when na.rm= TRUE is needed, and where it goes (mainly, functions like mean())
#	Use dplyr to find mean, sd, median, etc., by groups (using group_by).
#	Filter data values and create a new (filtered) data frame.
#	Filter out missing values for a particular variable from a data frame, using !is.na().
#	Arrange a data frame in ascending or descending order
#	Print the first or last few observations of a data frame
#	Create a new variable, and add it to the current data frame (mutate) 

```
### Conclusions

Describe the relationships briefly in terms of what they suggest about happiness.
